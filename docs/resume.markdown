### **Projects**

- [**Uart Transmitter**](https://github.com/eazyistired/UART_TRANSMITTER)

  A project developed during Infineon Summer School 2022

  - Designed and developed a module for asynchronous serial communication that relied on a single wire to transmit data bit by bit between
    devices.
  - Implemented a baud rate generator to control the transmission speed and developed a finite state machine to ensure reliable and errorfree
    data transfer.
  - Conducted thorough testing and debugging to meet functional specifications and performance requirements, while actively participating in
    code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and provide feedback to team members.

  - Technologies: verilog & system verilog
  - Relationship: author

- [**Legend of Zurak:**](https://github.com/eazyistired/legend_of_zurak)

  A small game for a python course I took.

  - Developed a Python‑based platformer game that features advanced collision detection logic and a fighting system for engaging gameplay.
  - Implemented physics‑based movement mechanics for character movement, adding a realistic touch to the gameplay experience.
  - Leveraged object‑oriented programming concepts to create a modular and scalable game engine, facilitating efficient code maintenance
    and future updates.

  - Technologies: python & pygame
  - Relationship: author

- [**ECCPR-2021**](https://github.com/eazyistired/ECCPR-2021)

  A collection of problems for my eccpr exam

  - Technologies: c++
  - Relationship: co-author

- **Image Manipulation**

  A project assigned by one of my professors during my first year at Uni, which aims to reduce the number of colors in an image using k-means clustering algorithm.

  - Achieved at least 60% reduction in image size while maintaining the quality of the original source through the use of advanced image compression
    techniques.
  - Applied k‑Means clustering algorithm to effectively reduce the number of colors in the image, accurately calculating the optimal RGB combination
    for each pixel.
  - Proficient in task management and version control using Git and GitKraken, effectively dividing and organizing project tasks to ensure efficient
    collaboration with team members.

  - Technologies: c++
  - Relationship: co-author
