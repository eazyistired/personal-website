## [UART-TRANSMITTER](https://github.com/eazyistired/UART_TRANSMITTER)

The project is an implementation of an Universal Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter developed during the first week of Infineon Summer School.

UART is a module used in asynchronous serial communication. Serial communication has the advantage of using only one wire for transmitting data from one device to another. At the reception, the data will be recovered from serial to parallel and used as usual.

<!-- We started by visiting the company's HQ in Bucharest. We saw their labs and their work flow and watched a presentation about all the stages of developing a product.

On the day after we began working on the project.
At first we started small: learned a few linux commands, downloaded X2GO and learned to use it.

After that we started working on our designs and tested them using Cadence XCelium:
