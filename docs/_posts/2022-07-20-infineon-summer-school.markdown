# Infineon Summer School

## [UART-TRANSMITTER](https://github.com/eazyistired/UART_TRANSMITTER)

The project is an implementation of an Universal Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter developed during the first week of Infineon Summer School.

UART is a module used in asynchronous serial communication. Serial communication has the advantage of using only one wire for transmitting data from one device to another. At the reception, the data will be recovered from serial to parallel and used as usual.
